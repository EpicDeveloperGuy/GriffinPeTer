 Lois, no one really needs glasses.
 Thats only to fool the man from the draft board.
 Wait a second. Rosenblatt? Greenstein? So youre saying I need a Jewish guy to handle my money?
 Well, yeah, I guess not the retarded ones, butbut why would you even say that? For shock value? Jeez, Cleveland, theres "edgy" and theres "offensive." Good day, sir!

reading Meg's sex pamphlet"If you have sex, your penis will fall off and land in another dimension populated entirely by dogs who will eat it". Well, that's something I'd like to avoid. Well, this changes everything! From now on, I too will be "obstinent".
 Absent.
 You're grounded.*
 Oh, that was fantastic. Hey, where'd you get that tattoo on your lower back?
 What?
 Oh, Smilla, your sense ofsnowis equalled only by your sense oflove!
 Lois, before I found these movies, women only made me cry through my penis. Now they make mecrythrough myeyes.
 How much for the gloves?
 10 bucks! $2! $7! $4! $5.50! $10! Sold!slylySucker. I would have gone to fifteen easy. I am so stupid.
 Uh, Meg, I got 16 candles for your birthday cake. How does that sound?
 So, less, more, too many, not enough?

 You know what, Lois? They're not the same thing. And the sooner you get that through your thick skull, the sooner we can get this marriage back on track.
 Hey, Meg, come here. Have a seat.she sits down next to him. Peter then does a fake yawn, stretches his arms out, and puts one around Meg
 Meg, I'm a redneck. Which means I am about to do something to you that you will not remember until you're 40.
 Meg, come back here! I meant sex!
 Hey, Bill, you up for a little bowling? I swiped some money out of Lois' purse. I don't think she'll notice, 'cause she's here, humping you?!
 I agree, Lois. Like, for instance, if you're watching a TV show and you decide to take your values from that... you're an idiot. Maybe you should take responsibility for what values your kids are getting. Maybe you shouldn't be letting your kids watch certain shows in the first place if you have such a big problem with them, instead of blaming the shows themselves.long pauseYeah.
 Horsey! You saved my life!
 Wow! Gilbert Gottfried!
 Awesome!
 No, Lois, I did not.The Nutcrackerhad zero physical comedy. Andand with a name likeThe Nutcracker, I thought, "Oh, this will be worth a few yuks." But no, Lois. That title wrote a check that the queers on stage refused to cash.
 Well, I wouldn't worry about it, Chris. I don't think people are even aware of that show's existence.
 Oh, really? Define decent.
 Well, yeah, but double ten people is like, twenty people, so what kind of numbers are we talking about here? Who knows?
 Uh, I don't know about that, Chris. I mean, to me a legitimate show is on ABC, CBS, NBC, you know, one of the REAL networks.
 And besides, what's up with that 15-minute run time? What is that? It's like 15 minutes of guys playing with "Star Wars" dolls. Oh, yay, yaaay! Tune me in for that.
 I read part of a review online. I'm not a fan.

 Oh, I believe I am. Driver's license, Social Security card, American Express.
 Well, Dave, I have a hilarious new movie comin' out onHBOnext month. It's all about 9/11. The movie's calledSeptember 11th, 2000-Fun.
 Well, you haven't heard what the movie's about. I play a window washer who has just finished washing the last window of the World Trade Center. And then I turn around to get off the scaffold, and what do you think I see coming? A plane! And I go, "Come on"! You know, it's real, real old-style comedy, you know, it's like two pies in the face, and one in a field in Pennsylvania.
 And the voice of the plane isDavid Spade.
 You know what else is rewarding, Lois? Shutting your vag.
 What?
 Hey, guys, what's going on?
 Guys, say hello toAdrian Beakey.
 Hey, isn't that funny? He heard me say that on the way over in the car.
uncomfortableUh, yeah, I had the radio on in the car and they were talking about some crazy stuff... So what are you-what are you guys drinkin'?
 Brian, can I see that paper for a sec?Brian hands him the paperHuh, that's odd. I thought that would be big news.

 Oh, have you not heard? It was my understanding that everyone had heard.
 You seem like a nice guy. Why don'tcha come over to my house for dinner tonight?
 Great! We'll have a blast. After we eat, we can watch that YouTube footage ofMarlee Matlincallin' Moviefone.

 Huh. Can you use it in a dirty sentence?

sighsI'm bored.
 Okay, I know you're a pilot and everything, but not everyone likes to talk about planes as much as you, Quagmire.
in a deep voiceI even won a deep voice contest with Joe.
 I made myself heard.
 I've come from where I've been.
 Fletcher met the long arm of the law at the wrong end of a shotgun in the deep end of a grave at the far end of a dead end road.
 Look, Lois! I have my friends and you have groceries and all those rusty pink razors in the shower. Now just stick to what's intended for you and leave my things to me.
 Hey, Horace, why don't ya take that wiener outta your hand and give me a beer!
 There's only one drinking spot for us and it's the Clam.
 Quagmire, when a girl says she doesn't want to have sex with you, do you take that as an answer?
 Is that my ass?
to LoisI want you on my team for everything... except for sports.
 Hey, Lois.
 No, I realised something after you left; It's not the treasure that matters. All that really matters is the money you get in exchange for the treasure. I guess I had to learn that the hard way.
glumlyWelp, now we know. I can taste what he eats.
 No that'sChocolateChip. We gave him back toKenya.
 Oh, he's eating.shouts at the doorWe'll come back when you're done eating!
 Well, sometimes Quagmire likes to hang out under all the clutter in my garage, so why don't we just start sorting stuff and throwing stuff away, but obviously checking with me first before you throw stuff away.
 Thanks, didn't want to pay for the hole.
laughsWhat's in the box, Brian? I got you good!Blood is coming out and comes to Peter's pantsI don't feel right. I want it back.Collapses
 Yes, yes, I swear.
 Yes, I promise. I'll never bother you again with my body. Please, just make this stop!
 Oh, I did that on the Italian "Shut-up-a-You-Facebook."
 Me too. We haven't done it like that since we were engaged, but allowed to sleep with other people.
 Kids, I've got an announcement...
 We're staying in Italy. We're Italian now.
 Holy crap, what the hell happened?!
 Aren't you supposed to be running around?
noddingChris, that's wildly inappropriate.
 Quagmire? I thought you were still out on the road!
 Wildly successful?
 My hog cannot partake in the slop this evening.
Jack and the Beanstalk. And that title could be a fairy tale or a porn. Let's find out.
 I'm doin' somethin'.chewsOne thing at a time!
 Well fine! I don't need your friendship anyway.
 Now this is a gun without a safety.
 Quite the difference, huh?
 All right, Quagmire, I have given this a lot of thought. I need you to shoot me in the arm and we can be friends again.
after realizing what he just told QuagmireWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! No, no, I was supposed to offer, and then you were supposed to say, "No, Peter, I'm not gonna shoot you, although I do appreciate the gesture."
 I, uh, pass the test?
under his breathYou do everything gross.
 Uh, maybe. Maybe Friday. Uh, now where are the gays?
 No, no, no. The really cartoony gays.
 There you are, we're gonna need you guys all week.
 And you still won't give us an Emmy?! Come on!! IfModern Familydid that joke, you'd be carryin' 'em around on your shoulders!!
 Okay, are you a television set of the Internet?
 Oh, then no.
 Yes. Keep being good, and all the eggshells and coffee grounds will be yours.
 You've overstepped! No Christmas!
 Don't flatter yourself, that was from this morning.
 Huh, it says "Glenn Quagmire". But if you squint and imagine it says "Peter Griffin", it says "Peter Griffin".
 Now, now, hold on, Lois. Now, this poses a very difficult ethical dilemma. Do I deliver the package to its rightful owner? Or do I open it up and see if it contains He-Mans?
 You shall battle to the death, or the winner will be given his freedom! Why are you looking at me like that?
 Oh, exemplary, Chris.
 Shall we away for "relations"?
 Lois, I'm sorry.
 Now, calm down, Lois. You're gonna say something you don't mean.
HurtYou don't mean that.
 I'm not an idiot!
 Awesome!
 That is a tough, tough place to get into. That is tough. But once you're in there, you'll be surprised how much you like it.
 I don't hate ya, Meg. You're my kid.
